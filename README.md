# [Project 2: Predicting the Succes of a startup based on Various Features](https://github.com/bxmaqsood/Startup-success/blob/main/Startup%20Success.ipynb)
*	Did predictive modeling for forecasting the success of the startup based on the features from the IEE research papers, Kaggle, and crunch base dataset solutions.
*	Trained multiple tree-based models (Decision, trees, Ada Boost, XGBoost) and Logistic regression and SVC and other Ensemble methods to get the best accuracy score.
*	Did hyperparameter tuning using the Grid search and K-fold cross-validation. Pruning for the tree-based models 
*	Found the best cities to start a business by calculating the odds ratio for all the features after one hot encoded feature.
*	Found the k-best features that contributed to predicting the success of the startups and averaged out the results for all models to find out the highest influencing features.

# [Project 2: STOCK PRICE PREDICTION OF 3 BIG TECH COMPANIES USING TIME SERIES FORECASTING]()
*	Visualized the data, did exploratory data analysis(EDA), and achieved stationarity by differencing after finding the non-stationary time series using the AD Fuller test.
*	Built a persistence model to get a benchmark for comparing the results, plotted autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to decide on the optimum number of lags for the autoregression and moving average model before fitting the models.
* Integrated the 3-time series back to get the actual predictions, plotted it to compare with the actual results, and looked for the insights from the projections to analyze the differences in investment decisions that we might have made based on predicted data vs the actual data.


# [Project 3: Estimating the value of Pi using inscribed circle and Circumscribed circle with Python](https://github.com/BilalMaqsood-ai/Bilal_Portfolio/blob/main/Estimating%20the%20value%20pi%20.ipynb)
*	Coded a favorite interview question of estimating the value of pi using an equilateral triangle.
*	Defined a function to call and try different values for for loop iteration.
*	Estimated the value of pi by up to 3 digits accurate after decimal points.
*	Plotted the scatter plot of the points using matplotlib library to visualize the results.
*	Tried the same for a Circumscribed circle
